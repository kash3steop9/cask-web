# cask-web

Schema Driven Design:

See `src/types.ts`

- Do we need the bottle series? Also sometimes series are for specific retailers, does that matter? e.g. Bottled for Healthy Spirits, Bottle #1345
- Should we have bottled dates or just bottled years?
- Is CaskType possible to constrain to an enum? Same question for Category.
- Tags make up a lot of flavor profiles - should things like the way its coal fired be focused on tasting notes more so than bottle or distiller information?

https://www.whiskybase.com/ is a good example of what the kind of db we need
